# SaasMint Core

Django 6 SaaS backend. Python 3.12, uv, PostgreSQL (testcontainers), Celery + Redis.

## Architecture

- `core/saasmint_core/` — framework-agnostic domain layer (domain models, services, repositories interfaces).
- `apps/` — Django apps (`users`, `billing`, `orgs`, `dashboard`, `admin_panel`). Each has models, views, serializers, urls, tests/.
- `config/` — Django settings (base/dev/test/prod), root urls, celery.
- `middleware/` — custom middleware (security, etc).
- Django apps implement repository interfaces from core and wire them to DRF views/serializers.
- Supabase: `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` is used both for JWT verification and as the service role key for Admin API calls. Do not add a separate `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` setting.

## Billing model

- Single-currency (USD) catalog. `PlanPrice` / `ProductPrice` store `amount` in cents, no `currency` column.
- `Plan` has `(context, tier, interval)` — `context` is `personal` or `team`, `tier` is `free`/`basic`/`pro`. Active rows are unique on that triple.
- `Subscription` covers two shapes:
  - Paid: `stripe_id` + `stripe_customer_id` set, lifecycle synced via webhooks.
  - Free: `stripe_id IS NULL`, `user_id` set directly. Created on signup (`apps.billing.services.assign_free_plan`) and on personal subscription cancellation (auto-fallback in `_on_subscription_deleted`). `Subscription.is_free` distinguishes them.
- `current_period_end` for free subs is the sentinel `FREE_SUBSCRIPTION_PERIOD_END` (year 9999) — they never renew.
- `Product` / `ProductPrice` are one-time purchases (credit packs / Boost), separate from subscription plans.
- Stripe API version is pinned to `2025-03-31.basil`. Notable: `cancel_at_period_end=True` is replaced by `cancel_at="min_period_end"` (clear with `cancel_at=""`); the singular `subscription.discount` is replaced by `discounts[]`; `current_period_start/end` live on subscription items, not the subscription itself.
- `make sync-stripe` (runs `manage.py sync_stripe_catalog`) is the source of truth for pushing local Plans/Products into Stripe. It should run after every `migrate` in deploy pipelines so Stripe matches the DB; it is idempotent via Stripe `lookup_key`s.

## Prism commands

Use Prism for all workflow operations — it is the source of truth for branching, reviews, and shipping:

- `/prism:create-branch` — create feature/fix/hotfix branches from the correct base
- `/prism:ship` — pre-ship checks, conventional commit, and push
- `/prism:review-and-fix` — run code review and fix all findings
- `/prism:review-and-report-only` — run review without fixing
- `/prism:address-pr-review` — address inline PR review comments
- `/prism:open-pr` — sync base, run tests, open PR
- `/prism:release` — open release PR from dev to main

## Pre-push checklist

Before pushing or opening a PR, always run:

```bash
make lint        # ruff check .
make typecheck   # mypy . (django + core)
make test        # pytest
```

Fix any errors before pushing. Do not skip this.

## Commands

```bash
make dev         # docker compose up (Django + Celery + Postgres + Redis)
make test        # pytest -v
make lint        # ruff check
make format      # ruff format
make typecheck   # mypy
make migrate     # run migrations (stack running)
```

## Code style

- Always use type hints in Python.
