"""Drop the dual-shape Subscription: delete free rows, drop the free-only constraint.

Subscription becomes a pure Stripe mirror — every row has a stripe_id. The free
tier is now represented by the *absence* of a Subscription rather than a row
with stripe_id IS NULL. Existing free Subscription rows and their seeded
free Plan are removed; the partial unique constraint that guarded "at most one
free sub per user" is dropped because no free rows exist any more.
